# Voleeversium

## Why
The lack of motivation for volunteering activities is the main driving force in designing this platform. We believe that with a right instrument, we would achieve to trigger the eagerness and raise the appetite in individuals and organizations for volunteering. We therefore decided to take the challenge to make a contribution to transforming the world for the better.

## Description
Voleeversium is a brand new platform where volunteers can play varying roles to leave their footprints in volunteering efforts. Simply, the Volee is who takes part in the volunteering activity that the VNPO creates and, with that collects the Voleecoins, while the Voleehero is the one who generates coupon to keep motivation up.

The crucial point is motivation, which lies at the core concept of Voleeversium. Vollee offers time and skill, VNPO frames the activity, and finally, Voleehero cultivates the source of motivation, by providing coupons to the platform which Volee can obtain, using the Volleecoins.
Voleeversium typically forms a pool especially for Volee and VNPO to link up without requiring many tiresome efforts to connect to the right volunteers and find the right activities. Organizations(VNPO) have a chance to reach out beyond their hinterlands.
Volee and VNPO input skills and requirements and then match with each other if fit both.

## How we built
We used following technologies to achieve the goal:
Figma for designing
React.js for front--end,
Node.js for back-end
Mysql for database
Sqlz for ORM

## Challenges we ran into
We had a long discussion how to create a login module which, effected negatively the schedule in the limited time span. Designing the UI was another challenge that we had to went through several times to decide on the features to best suit the users` needs.
Since we attended Hackathon online, we face obstacles finding a suitable location to manage the entire process.

## Accomplishments that weâ€™re proud of
The idea generated at the end of the brainstorming session satisfied the whole team members. That motivated the the team and promoted awareness of pursuing collective actions to advocate for shared goal.
Furher, being able to built a tool that serves the idea and functions in a way the team planed is another reason for team to be proud of.

## What we learned
When struggling for the solution to the subject, the let us epathize for the organizations looking for wolintering. That encouraged us to volunteer.
